Nomoskar! Welcome to BeerJS Kolkata!

BeerJS Kolkata is a community for devs and javascript enthusiasts. The primary aim of this community is to learn and express our love towards Beer and JS through workshops, meetups and hackathons.

We'd like to create a community where people can share their experiences on technology, discuss trends, frameworks and hobbies! We value good beer and good code and encourage the sharing of both. However, your experience with Javascript or beer does not matter as long as you're willing to collaborate and enjoy yourself.

We express mutual respect and regard to all members of the BeerJS community in a bid to be open to newcomers and architects alike.

__Disclaimer:__

> There is **NO** compulsion to consume any alchohol. You can totally be a vital part of BEERJS meetups and hackathons otherwise also.

__If you'd like to sponsor us, reach out to anyone from the team__

Beer, Pizza and/or a Coworking space are **always** in great demand.
